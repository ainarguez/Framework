<p><b>One of the most exciting projects I've worked on</b> is a framework that we started from scratch.<p>
 
</p> This project has been developed as a team, and every day I continue to improve it in our classes.</p>

<p>The idea behind this framework is to create a solid foundation for web application development, and throughout the process, I've learned a lot about:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Teamwork</li>
 <li>Problem-solving</li>
 <li>Applying best programming practices</li>
</ul>
<p>As we continue moving forward, I keep refining my skills and contributing to the project, which motivates me to keep learning and growing as a developer.</p>
